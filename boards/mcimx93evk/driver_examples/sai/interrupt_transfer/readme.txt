Overview
========
The sai_interrupt_transfer example shows how to use sai driver with interrupt:

In this example, one sai instance playbacks the audio data stored in flash/SRAM using interrupt.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.30.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MCIMX93-EVK  board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V~20V power supply
- Personal Computer
- Headphone

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Note
Please run the application in Low Power boot mode (without Linux BSP).
The IP module resource of the application is also used by Linux BSP.
Or, run with Single Boot mode by changing Linux BSP to avoid resource
conflict.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V~20V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW301 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J1401 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either re-power up your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, you can hear the tone and the log would be seen on the terminal like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SAI example started!
SAI example finished!
