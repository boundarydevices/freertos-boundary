Overview
========
The RGPIO Example project is a demonstration program that uses the SDK software to manipulate the general-purpose
outputs.
The example is supported by the set, clear, and toggle write-only registers for each port output data register. The 
example take turns to shine the LED.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.30.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MIMX8ULP-EVK  board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 5V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

#### Please note this application can't support running with Linux BSP! ####

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 5V power supply and JLink Plus to the board, switch SW10 to power on the board
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J17 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Build the project
5.  Generate flash.bin with imx-mkimage and download it according to Getting Started doc
6.  Open two serials lines provided at J17 USB port.
    (e.g. /dev/ttyUSB0~3, /dev/ttyUSB2 for A Core, /dev/ttyUSB3 for M Core)
7.  Repower on board and stop in U-Boot command line.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the RGB LED(U15) on board will shine with blue light and the following message is displayed in the terminal:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
