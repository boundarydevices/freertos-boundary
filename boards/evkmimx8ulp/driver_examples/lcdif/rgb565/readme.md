Overview
========
This example demonstrates how to use the LCDIF driver to show the RGB565 format
frame buffer. When the example runs, a rectangle is moving in the screen, and
its color changes when touch border.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.15.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.40.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MIMX8ULP-EVK/EVK9 board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 5V power supply
- RK055AHD091 panel or RK055MHD091 panel

Board settings
==============
Connect the MIPI panel to MIMX8ULP-EVK board J18.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 5V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW10 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J17 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Build the project, this project uses RK055MHD091 panel by default, to use the RK055AHD091 panel,
    change #define USE_MIPI_PANEL MIPI_PANEL_RK055MHD091 to #define USE_MIPI_PANEL MIPI_PANEL_RK055AHD091
    in lcdif_support.h.
5.  Generate flash.bin with imx-mkimage and download it according to Getting Started doc
6.  Open two serials lines provided at J17 USB port.
    (e.g. /dev/ttyUSB0~3, /dev/ttyUSB2 for A Core, /dev/ttyUSB3 for M Core)
7.  Boot to uboot and let uboot not using diplay
    => setenv video_off yes;saveenv
    then re-power on the board
8.  Let Stop in Uboot

Running the demo
================
When the example runs, the screen shows what described in overview.
