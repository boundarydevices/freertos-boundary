Overview
========
The flexio_spi_master_interrupt_lpspi_slave example shows how to use flexio spi master driver in interrupt way:

In this example, a flexio simulated master connect to a lpspi slave .



SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.60.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MIMX8ULP-EVK/EVK9 board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 5V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
1.The example requires connecting the FLEXIO0 pins with the LPSPI1 pins;
Please use four dupont lines to connect pins on MIMX8ULP-EVK base board as following:
- ARDU_D3/PTB0_FXIO0_D16/PCS(J21,4), ARDU_A0/PTA15_LPSPI1_PCS0(J23,1) connected
- ARDU_D2/PTB1_FXIO0_D17/SOUT(J21,3), ARDU_A1/PTA16_LPSPI1_SIN(J23,2) connected
- ARDU_D1/PTB2_FXIO0_D18/SIN(J21,2), ARDU_A2/PTA17_LPSPI1_SOUT(J23,3) connected
- ARDU_D0/PTB3_FXIO0_D19/SCK(J21,1), ARDU_A3/PTA18_LPSPI1_SCK(J23,4) connected

2.Remove the resistors R139,R159 and add the resistors R140,R158 on base board;

#### Please note this application can't support running with Linux BSP! ####

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 5V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW10 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J17 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FLEXIO Master - LPSPI Slave interrupt example start.
This example use one flexio spi as master and one lpspi instance as slave on one board.
Master and slave are both use interrupt way.
Please make sure you make the correct line connection. Basically, the connection is:
FLEXIO_SPI_master -- LPSPI_slave   
       SCK        --    SCK
       PCS        --    PCS  
       SOUT       --    SIN  
       SIN        --    SOUT 
This is LPSPI slave call back.
FLEXIO SPI master <-> LPSPI slave transfer all data matched!

End of example.
