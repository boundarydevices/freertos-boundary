Overview
========
This example shows how to use the PXP Porter Duff compositing. In this example,
A blue rectangle is in the left up corner of the destination surface (also named
PS surface, or s0 in reference mannal). A red rectangle is in the center of the
source surface (also named AS surface, or s1 in reference mannal). Every Porter Duff
mode result is shown 2 seconds, then switch to the other mode.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.30.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MIMX8ULP-EVK/EVK9 board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 5V power supply
- RK055AHD091(rm68200) panel or RK055MHD091(hx8394) panel

Board settings
==============
Connect the MIPI panel to MIMX8ULP-EVK board J18.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 5V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW10 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J17 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Build example to generate sdk20-app.bin
Note: 
  RK055MHD091 panel is used by default, to use the RK055AHD091 panel, modifications as below:
    - change "#define DEMO_PANEL DEMO_PANEL_RK055MHD091" to "#define DEMO_PANEL MIPI_PANEL_RK055AHD091" in display_support.h
5.  Generate flash.bin with imx-mkimage and download it according to Getting Started doc
6.  Open two serials lines provided at J17 USB port.
    (e.g. /dev/ttyUSB0~3, /dev/ttyUSB2 for A Core, /dev/ttyUSB3 for M Core)
7.  Press the reset button on your board and boot to uboot and let uboot not using diplay peripherals
    => setenv video_off yes;saveenv
    then re-power on the board
8.  Let Stop in Uboot.
