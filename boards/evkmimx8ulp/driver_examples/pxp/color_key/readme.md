Overview
========
The PXP color key project shows how to use the AS color key together with the
alpha blend. In this example, the AS pixel format is RGB565, the global alpha
is used for alpha blend.

The PS frame buffer is like this:

+---------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                 |                                   |

|           BLUE                  |             RED                   |
|                                 |                                   |
|                                 |                                   |
|                                 |                                   |
|                                 |                                   |
|                                 |                                   |
|                                 |                                   |
|                                 |                                   |
|                                 |                                   |
|                                 |                                   |
+---------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

The AS frame buffer is square like this:

               +---------------------------------+
               |                                 |
               |                                 |
               |             GREEN               |
               |                                 |
               |        +---------------+        |
               |        |               |        |
               |        |               |        |
               |        |               |        |
               |        |    YELLOW     |        |
               |        |               |        |
               |        |               |        |
               |        |               |        |
               |        +---------------+        |
               |                                 |
               |                                 |
               |                                 |
               +---------------------------------+

The AS is placed in the center of the screen. The AS color key is set to yellow
color, the blend alpha value is set to 128. So in the output frame buffer, the
originally yellow region shows PS color, the green region is blend with PS color.
The screen shows the output frame like this:

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.60.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MIMX8ULP-EVK/EVK9 board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 5V power supply
- RK055AHD091(rm68200) panel or RK055MHD091(hx8394) panel

Board settings
==============
Connect the MIPI panel to MIMX8ULP-EVK board J18.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 5V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW10 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J17 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Build example to generate sdk20-app.bin
Note: 
  RK055MHD091 panel is used by default, to use the RK055AHD091 panel, modifications as below:
    - change "#define DEMO_PANEL DEMO_PANEL_RK055MHD091" to "#define DEMO_PANEL MIPI_PANEL_RK055AHD091" in display_support.h
5.  Generate flash.bin with imx-mkimage and download it according to Getting Started doc
6.  Open two serials lines provided at J17 USB port.
    (e.g. /dev/ttyUSB0~3, /dev/ttyUSB2 for A Core, /dev/ttyUSB3 for M Core)
7.  Press the reset button on your board and boot to uboot and let uboot not using diplay peripherals
    => setenv video_off yes;saveenv
    then re-power on the board
8.  Let Stop in Uboot.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs, the screen shows what described in overview.
The log below shows the output of the demo in the terminal window:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
LCDIF pixel clock is: 66000000Hz
