Overview
========
The flexcan_loopback example shows how to use the loopback test mode to debug your CAN Bus design:

To demonstrates this example, only one board is needed. The example will config one FlexCAN Message
Buffer to Rx Message Buffer and the other FlexCAN Message Buffer to Tx Message Buffer with same ID.
After that, the example will send a CAN Message from the Tx Message Buffer to the Rx Message Buffer
through internal loopback interconnect and print out the Message payload to terminal.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.15.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.40.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MIMX8ULP-EVK/EVK9 board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 5V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 5V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW10 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J17 USB port on the cpu board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.
